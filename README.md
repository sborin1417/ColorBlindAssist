# ColorBlindAssist

## Motivation
  Color Blind Assist is a oftware designed to help individuals with deuteranopia (red-green colorblindness caused by defficiency in green cones), protanopia (red-green colorblindness caused by deficiency in red cones) and tritanopia (blue-yellow colorblindness caused by deficiency in blue cones) view images in a more accessable way. 

  The software allows the user to select an image on their device for processing. They can then select which type of colorblindness affects them (for best visual experience). Additionally, they can choose to have the image alteration be only a percentage of the full, traditional operation. This allows more flexibility for the user. 

## How to Run
  Color Blind Assist is contained in a single Java file and can easily be run using VisualStudio Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse, or any other Java compiler of your choice. Keep in mind that this code contains switch statements which are only supported in newer versions of Java.
